# Machine Learning Course Assignments and Solutions

This repository contains my assignments and solutions for the **Machine Learning** course offered in Fall 2024 at National Taiwan University (NTU), instructed by Professor Hsuan-Tien Lin. The assignments cover various topics in machine learning, including linear regression, hypothesis testing, logistic regression, and more.

## Course Information
- **Course Title**: Machine Learning
- **Instructor**: Hsuan-Tien Lin
- **Institution**: National Taiwan University (NTU)
- **Semester**: Fall 2024

## Repository Contents
This repository includes the following materials:
1. **Assignment Problems**: The problem sets as provided in the course, outlining tasks related to machine learning theories and applications.
2. **Solutions**: My detailed answers and code implementations for each assignment problem, following the course guidelines.

### Assignments Included:
1. **Homework #3**: 
   - Focuses on hypothesis sets, linear regression, logistic regression, and real-world data applications.
   - Covers theoretical questions as well as coding exercises that involve:
     - Derivation of the optimal weights in linear regression.
     - Exploration of different error functions and hypothesis sets.
     - Experiments with linear regression using a real-world dataset (`cpusmall_scale`).
   - **Due Date**: October 21, 2024

## Instructions
The assignments are completed in accordance with the course’s academic integrity policy. Solutions are written individually and are based on my understanding of the concepts.

### Structure
- Each assignment folder contains:
  - `Problem_Set.pdf`: The original assignment questions.
  - `solutions/`: A folder containing solution files:
    - `problem_n_solution.pdf`: My detailed answers for theoretical problems.
    - `problem_n_code.py`: Python scripts for coding-related problems.

### How to Use
1. **View Problems and Solutions**: Each problem’s solution is documented, with explanations for each step.
2. **Run Code**:
   - Ensure Python 3.x and the necessary libraries (e.g., NumPy, matplotlib) are installed.
   - Open the `.py` files in your preferred Python environment and run them to see the outputs.
3. **Datasets**:
   - Some problems involve specific datasets, such as `cpusmall_scale`, which can be downloaded from [LibSVM Data](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/regression/cpusmall_scale).
   - The code files are configured to read this dataset locally, so ensure the dataset is in the correct directory before running the code.

### Key Topics Covered
- **Linear Regression**: Implementation, analysis of the error functions, and experiments on different sample sizes.
- **Hypothesis Sets**: Evaluation of different hypothesis classes based on their VC dimensions and their impact on model performance.
- **Error Analysis**: Comparison of in-sample and out-of-sample errors to assess model generalization capabilities.
- **Real-World Application**: Experiments on real-world data to understand the practical implications of theoretical concepts.
